Mocking:
- Mock only external dependencies (API, browser).

Error Handling:
- Test error throwing mechanisms.
- Avoid testing `console` output.

Components and State:
- Do not test presentational components.
- Test state stores thoroughly.
- Test container/smart components.
- Assert component/application state changes.
